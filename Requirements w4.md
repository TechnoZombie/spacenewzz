## Introduction

Hooks play a crucial role in the React Library, and up to now, we've focused mainly on two fundamental ones: `useState` and `useEffect`. But as you've probably noticed, there's a whole bunch more waiting to be discovered, and the list on the React documentation can be pretty overwhelming. That's why we've taken it step by step, starting with these two.

Now, to level up our game, we're going to expand our toolkit with a few more hooks. We'll keep things simple and build on what we already know. Here are some of the next hooks you should learn:

1. `useRef`
2. `useContext`
3. `useReducer`
4. `useMemo`
5. `useCallback`

These will give us even more power and flexibility when building our React applications.

In addition to diving deeper into hooks, we're also going to revisit another important topic: routing. This time, though, we'll be exploring routing within the context of React, and for that, we'll be using a widely-used library known for its reliability and effectiveness: **React Router**. It's a tool that's essential for many projects, and mastering it will take our React skills to the next level. And to explore this library, we will introduce a new challenge for the Space Flight News Project, that is a navigation with some new pages.
